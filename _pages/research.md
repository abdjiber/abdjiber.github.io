Postdoctoral Fellow, Simon Fraser University, Canada (Aug 2022 - Now)

According to research, age-related cognitive decline (or normal cognitive decline) is not a consistent process from person to person. Some people have normal cognitive decline, whereas others have substantial cognitive decline which can progress to neurodegenerative disorders like dementia. There is currently no cure for dementia. Fortunately, there is evidence in the literature for factors to preserve excellent cognitive health in later life. My major goal is attempting to determine whether modifiable cognitive decline risk factors, such as lifestyle activities, can help to make the older adult population healthy on both an individual and population level.

In addition to my major research, I'm active at other projects in my laboratory. Among the projects are:
- Determining the link between the gut microbiota and the brain, commonly known as the gut-microbiota brain axis.
- Determining the link between profession and brain alterations, often known as occupational brain plasticity.
- Determining which lifestyle activities aid in the rehabilitation from a traumatic brain injury.

In addition to the aforementioned projects, I co-supervise master's and Ph.D. students from my laboratory.
Postdoctoral Fellow, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (May - July 2022)

When my work at Prevision.io was suspended owing to the company's financial troubles, I began a postdoctoral fellow position at my previous institution (the company fired more than half of its employees - 20 due to nonsuccess in fundraising). I held my present postdoctoral fellow employment at the time, but I needed time for administrative processes to transfer to Canada. I subsequently began a postdoctoral position in my old lab, where I worked on designing a novel Machine Learning model for detecting anomalies and concept drifts (i.e. statistical changes in data over time) in data streams. This work was done in partnership with an industry partner (Pfeiffer Vaccum) who wanted to incorporate our approach into their products.

**DragStream** is a novel anomaly and idea drift detector in data streams that we suggested. Our article has been approved for presentation at the incremental learning workshop of the international conference on data mining 2022 (IncLearn ICDM, ranking A*), which was held in Florida from November 28th to December 1st, 2022.

I also co-supervised two graduate research projects on Explainable AI (XAI) and Dimensionality Reduction in Data Streams.

Prevision.io, France (Oct - Feb 2022)

During the first year of my Ph.D.(2018 - 2019), I received an offer from Prevision.io. Prevision.io contacted me after I defeated one of their workers using Prevision.io's automated machine learning (AutoML) software in a data science competition (read more [here](https://abdjiber.github.io/posts/2019/07/data-science-follow-up)). I wanted to finish my Ph.D., so I requested Prevision.io to keep the position open for me until I graduated, and they agreed. Unfortunately, because to a lack of success in acquiring funds during the Covid-19 epidemic, the firm laid off more than half of its staff, including me.

I mostly worked on the European project [AIDOaRT](https://www.aidoart.eu/) at Prevision.io. (AI-augmented automation for effective DevOps, a model-based framework for continuous development at runtime in cyber-physical systems.) The initiative engaged 32 organizations, including academic and industry partners, during a three-year period (2021-2024). We were in responsible of building AIDOaRT's explainability and accountability services at Prevision.io, along with a coworker (who was also sacked). We began studying the literature to identify current XAI models that are appropriate for data provided by various cyber-physical systems, with the goal of establishing an API that can be used to explain any ML model from the framework. In addition to this work, I contributed to a comprehensive evaluation of the literature of studies that utilised at least two of the following aspects: Model-based engineering, DevOps, and AI.

In addition, I was in charge of producing technical articles for data science specialists to explain how certain of Prevision.io's products functioned. I contributed seven articles to the Prevision.io blog (the former website is down).

Prevision.io helped me to build and market machine learning apps based on my ideas. I built a YouTube ad detector using powerful Deep Learning algorithms and released it on Prevision.io.

PhD thesis, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (Oct - Feb 2022)
------
My Ph.D. thesis was primarily concerned with the creation of novel ML models for clustering qualitative data. I created two methods: **CFE** (Categorical Fuzzy Entropy c-means) based on the [fuzzy sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy set) theory and **CatECM** (Categorical Evidential C-Means) based on the [Dempster-Shafer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dempster%E2%80%93Shafer theory (also known as the belief functions theory). Both approaches are k-means extensions that deal with ambiguity.

During my thesis, I worked on two projects with others. One with [Institut Analgesia], a French institute specialized in chronic pain (https://www.institut-analgesia.org/?lang=en). The latter cooperation attempted to employ machine learning techniques to create profiles of chronic pain sufferers in order to provide tailored treatment. I had the opportunity to collaborate with physicians and pharmacists throughout this partnership, and we published a [paper](https://formative.jmir.org/2022/3/e30052).

The [Digital Health Research Laboratory](https://computationalgeronneuroscience.iat.sfu.ca/) was my second cooperation (my current lab). I worked on longitudinal data clustering of an older adult population to investigate how lifestyle activities impact each cluster.

Overall, my Ph.D. thesis resulted in four [publications](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdoul-Jalil-Djiberou-Mahamadou): articles from ResearchGate and the following [conference paper](https://editions-rnti.fr/?inprocid=1002697).

Master's thesis, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (Apr - Aug 2018)
------
I completed a research master's internship at my old lab prior to completing my Ph.D. thesis. My research focused on physical activity advice utilizing clustering and the creation of a novel clustering algorithm based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. I worked on the theoretical aspect of **CatECM** for the clustering approach, which included defining and addressing the method's optimization issue.

Peer-review (2019 - Now)
------
I have been volunturing to review journal and conference papers. So far, I reviewed papers from:
- BDA: International Hybrid Conference on Big Data Analytics
- DSAA: IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics
- ITAT: Conference on Information Technologies - Applications and Theory
- Complex Networks: International Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications 
- JRI: Journées de la Recherche en Informatique

Grants and Scholarships
------
Competitive grant and scholarship applications have aided my studies. The French National Research Agency provided me with three years of support for my Ph.D. thesis, totaling 105 000 EUR. Mitacs provided me with CAD 120 000 for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at Simon Fraser University.
