Postdoctoral Fellow, Stanford and GSK.ai, US (June 2023 - Now)
------
I'm a fellow at Stanford and GSK.ai in AI and Biomedical Ethics under the supervision of Pr. Russ Altman, Pr. Mildred Cho and Pr. David Magnus. 

Postdoctoral Fellow, Simon Fraser University, Canada (Aug 2022 - June 2023)
------
My research is focused on studying cognitive decline in older adults, specifically looking at modifiable factors such as lifestyle choices that may impact cognitive health and preserve cognitive abilities in later life. I'm particularly interested in researching the link between the gut microbiome and the brain, the link between profession and brain changes, and identifying lifestyle activities that can aid in the rehabilitation from traumatic brain injury. In addition to previous projects, my main work (Jan 2023 - Present) holds on developing a causal model for time series data with applications to longitudinal surveys and Image data. I'm also co-supervising graduate students in my laboratory.

Postdoctoral Fellow, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (May - July 2022)

After my employment was suspended at Prevision.io due to financial difficulties, I began a postdoctoral fellow position at my previous institution. I had already secured a postdoctoral fellow position at Simon Fraser University but needed to complete the administrative process of transferring to Canada. While awaiting that process, I returned to my former lab where I worked on developing a new Machine Learning model for identifying anomalies and changes in data streams over time. This project was done in partnership with Pfeiffer Vacuum, who intended to integrate our approach into their products. We named this model DragStream, and it was published at the 2022 International Conference on Data Mining's Incremental Learning Workshop (IncLearn ICDM) held in Florida from November 28th - December 1st, 2022. During this time, I also co-supervised two graduate research projects on Explainable AI (XAI) and dimensionality reduction in data streams.


Prevision.io, France (Oct - Feb 2022)
------
I was offered a job at Prevision.io during the first year of their Ph.D. after defeating Prevision.io's AutoML software and holding first place over +200 in a data science competition ((read more [here](https://abdjiber.github.io/posts/2019/07/data-science-follow-up)). I requested to keep the position open until I graduated and the company agreed. However, due to financial difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the company laid off more than half of its staff, including me. During their time at Prevision.io, they worked on a European project called [AIDOaRT](https://www.aidoart.eu/) which aimed to develop AI-augmented automation for effective DevOps and a model-based framework for continuous development at runtime in cyber-physical systems. With a colleague, we were responsible for building AIDOaRT's explainability and accountability services. I also contributed to a comprehensive evaluation of the literature of studies that related to Model-based engineering, DevOps, and AI and wrote seven technical articles for data science specialists to explain how certain of Prevision.io's products worked. As Prevision.io gave me the opportunity to develop my own ideas, I built a YouTube ad detector using powerful Deep Learning algorithms and released it on Prevision.io's platform (taken down).

PhD thesis, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (Oct - Feb 2022)
------
During my Ph.D., I focused on developing novel Machine Learning models for clustering qualitative data. I created two methods, CFE (Categorical Fuzzy Entropy c-means) and CatECM (Categorical Evidential C-Means), which are extensions of the k-means algorithm that can handle ambiguity. Both methods are based on fuzzy set theory and Dempster-Shafer theory respectively.

Throughout my Ph.D., I also worked on two collaborative projects with external organizations. The first was with the Institut Analgesia, a French institute that specializes in chronic pain treatment, where we used machine learning techniques to create profiles of chronic pain patients in order to provide personalized treatment. We published a paper on our findings. The second collaboration was with the Digital Health Research Laboratory (my current lab), where I worked on clustering longitudinal data of an older adult population to investigate the impact of lifestyle activities on different clusters.

Master's thesis, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (Apr - Aug 2018)
------
Before completing my Ph.D. thesis, I did a research master's internship at my previous lab, where I focused on using clustering to provide physical activity recommendations and developed a new clustering algorithm using the Dempster-Shafer theory. My work involved exploring the theoretical aspect of the CatECM clustering approach and addressing its optimization issues.

Peer review (2019 - Now)
------
I have been volunteering to review journal and conference papers. So far, I reviewed papers from:
- BDA: International Hybrid Conference on Big Data Analytics
- DSAA: IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics
- ITAT: Conference on Information Technologies - Applications and Theory
- Complex Networks: International Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications 
- JRI: Journées de la Recherche en Informatique

Grants and Scholarships
------
Competitive grant and scholarship applications have aided my studies. The French National Research Agency provided me with three years of support for my Ph.D. thesis, totaling 105 000 EUR. Mitacs provided me with CAD 120 000 for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at Simon Fraser University.
