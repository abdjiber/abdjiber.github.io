Postdoctoral Fellow, Simon Fraser University, Canada (Aug 2022 - Now)

Research has shown that age-related cognitive decline (or normal cognitive decline) is not a uniform process from one individual to another. While some individuals experience low cognitive decline others can experience severe decline which can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. To date, there is no cure for dementia. Fortunately, studies in the literature reported evidence for a mechanism to maintain good cognitive health and prevent dementia. My main project tries to understand which modifiable cognitive decline risk factors such as lifestyle activities can contribute to making the older adult population healthier at the individual and the population level.

In parallel with my main project, I'm involved in several projects conducted in my laboratory. The projects include:
- Understanding the relationship between gut-microbiota and the brain also referred to as the gut-microbiota brain axis.
- Understanding the relationship between occupation and brain changes also referred to as occupational brain plasticity.
- Understanding which lifestyle activities contribute to better recovery after a traumatic brain injury.

In addition to the previous projects, I'm involved in the co-supervision of masters and Ph.D. students from my laboratory.

Postdoctoral Fellow, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (May - July 2022)

I started a postdoctoral fellow position at my former university when my position at Prevision.io got interrupted due to financial difficulties of the company (the company fired more than half of its employees - 20 due to nonsuccess in fundraising). At that period, I had my current postdoctoral fellow position but needed time for administrative procedures to move to Canada. I then started a postdoc in my former lab where I worked on developing a new Machine Learning model for anomaly and concept drifts (i.e. statistical changes of data over time) detection in data streams. This work was in collaboration with an industry partner (Pfeiffer Vaccum) who was interested in deploying our model into their products. 

We proposed **DragStream**, a new anomaly and concept drift detector in data streams. Our paper is accepted at the incremental learning workshop of the international conference on data mining 2022 (IncLearn ICDM, ranking A*) which will take place from November 28th to December 1srt 2022 in Florida.

In addition to this work, I co-supervised two graduate research projects on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Dimensionality Reduction in data streams.

Prevision.io, France (Oct - Feb 2022)
------
I got an offer from Prevision.io during the first year of my Ph.D. (2018 - 2019). Prevision.io reached out to me after beating one of their employees who used Prevision.io's automated machine learning (AutoML) product to lead a data science competition (read more [here](https://abdjiber.github.io/posts/2019/07/data-science-follow-up)). I wanted to finish my Ph.D. and asked Prevision.io if they could keep the position for me until I graduate and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to nonsuccess in funding raising during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company fired more than half of its employees including me.

At Prevision.io, I mainly worked on the European project [AIDOaRT](https://www.aidoart.eu/) (AI-augmented automation for efficient DevOps, a model-based framework for continuous development At RunTime in cyber-physical systems). The three-year project (2021 - 2024) involved 32 organizations including academic and industrial partners. At Prevision.io, With a colleague (who got fired too), we were in charge of developing the explainability and accountability services of AIDOaRT. We started reviewing the literature to determine existing XAI models that are suitable for data generated from different cyber-physical systems and had a plan of developing an API that can be used to explain any ML model from the framework. At the consortium level, I contributed to a systematic review of the literature of studies that used at least two of the following dimensions of the framework: Model-based engineering, DevOps, and AI.

I was also in charge of writing technical articles for data science professionals to explain how some of Prevision.io's products work. I wrote 7 articles that were published on Prevision.io's blog (the former website is down).

Prevision.io allowed me to develop and deploy ML applications from my ideas. I developed a Youtube ads detector using advanced Deep Learning techniques and deployed it on Prevision.io.

PhD thesis, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (Oct - Feb 2022)
------
My Ph.D. thesis was mainly focused on the development of new ML models to cluster qualitative data. I developed two methods: **CFE** (Categorical Fuzzy Entropy c-means) under the [fuzzy sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_set) theory and **CatECM** (Categorical Evidential C-Means) under the [Dempster-Shafer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dempster%E2%80%93Shafer_theory) (belief functions) theory. Both methods are extensions of the k-means algorithms that handle uncertainty.

I had two collaborations during my thesis. One with [Institut Analgesia](https://www.institut-analgesia.org/?lang=en) a french institute specializing in chronic pain. The latter collaboration aimed to use machine learning techniques to determine profiles of chronic pain patients for individualized medicine. During this collaboration, I had the opportunity to work with physicians and pharmacists with whom we published a [paper](https://formative.jmir.org/2022/3/e30052).

My second collaboration was with the [Digital Health Research Laboratory](https://computationalgeronneuroscience.iat.sfu.ca/) (my current lab). I worked on clustering of an older adult population from longitudinal data to determine how lifestyle activities influence each cluster.

Overall, my Ph.D. thesis led to 4 [publications](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdoul-Jalil-Djiberou-Mahamadou): articles from ResearchGate and the following [conference paper](https://editions-rnti.fr/?inprocid=1002697).

Master's thesis, Université Clermont Auvergne, France (Apr - Aug 2018)
------
Before my Ph.D. thesis, I did a research master's internship at my former lab. My work held on physical activities recommendation using clustering and the development of a new clustering algorithm under the Dempster-Shafer theory. For the clustering method, I worked on the theoretical part of **CatECM** which includes, defining and solving the optimization problem of the method.
