About
------
Hey there! Welcome to my website! I'm Abdoul, I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Simon Fraser University in Canada. I hold a Ph.D. and Master's degree in Computer Science, an Engineer's degree in Applied Mathematics, and a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. My work experience has mainly been in developing new Machine Learning models and applying exciting techniques to get insights from health data. My current research interests hold on determining modifiable factors such as lifestyle activities (as opposed to non-modifiable factors such as age or genetics) that can contribute to making the older adult population healthier. I'm currently working on several exciting projects ranging from analyzing data from traumatic brain injury patients to determining the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain. The interdisciplinarity of neuroscience and cognitive science has given me a unique opportunity to work with amazing people around the World.


My Love Story With Mathematics And Computer Science

Since my junior high school in Niger, mathematics has been among the domain for which I couldn't see time flying when solving problems. In 2012, I received a bachelor's scholarship based on academic success to study mathematics in Morocco. During my curriculum there, I discovered for the first time computer programming and fell in love with it. My goal at that time was to become an applied mathematics engineer so that I'll have the opportunity to do mathematics and computer science at the same. In 2018 I achieved the dream and doubly graduated in applied mathematics engineering et a master's in computer science, both with honors. During the latter curriculums, I was introduced to machine learning and wanted to learn more. I then did a Ph.D. thesis in computer science and machine learning during which I developed new clustering algorithms.

Overall, I've always been excited and interested in solving problems and I do think that mathematics and computer science are great tools to help us understand and solve complex problems which can lead to having great impacts on our society and facilitate our daily living.
