About 
------
I'm a Stanford and GSK.ai postdoctoral fellow in AI and Biomedical Ethics. My work explores 1) how AI developers conceptualize and formalize bias and fairness into technical mitigation strategies; 2) how diversity and inclusion are conceptualized in NIH-funded projects (PIs: Dr. Nichol-Martinez Martin and Dr. Mildred Cho); and 3) the ethical implications of healthcare AI tools used at Stanford Healthcare (PIs: Dr. Michelle Mello and Dr. Danton Char). Before Stanford, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in AI and cognitive aging at Simon Fraser University in Canada where I used AI to determine lifestyle activities that influence cognitive decline in older adults. I completed a short postdoctoral fellowship in France where I contributed to developing a new explainable and concept drift detection algorithm for stream data.  

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, an MSc in Computer Science, an MEng in Applied Mathematics from Clermont Auvergne University in France (joint degree with MSc), and a BSc in Applied Mathematics from the University of Fez in Morocco. I received prestigious grants, awards, and distinctions including the Mitacs Accelerate Postdoctoral Fellowship Grant and the top-performing Nigerien students in France in 2019.
