About
------
Hey there! I'm Abdoul, I'm postdoctoral fellow at the Simon Fraser University in Canada. I hold a PhD and Master's degrees in Computer Science, an Engineer's degree in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor in Applied Mathematics. My work experience have mainly been on developing new machine learning models and applying exiting techniques to get inshights from health data. My current research interests hold on determing modifiable factors such as lifestyle activities (as opposed to non-modifiable factors such as age or genetics) that can contribute to making the older adult population healthier. I'm currently working several exiting projects ranging from analysing data from traumatic brain injury patients to determining the relationship between the gut-microbiome and the brain. The interdisplinarity of neuroscience and cognitve science has given me a unique opportunity to working with amazing people around the World.


My Love Story With Mathematics And Computer Science
------
Since my junior high school in Niger, mathematics has been among the domain for which I couldn't see the time flying when solving problems. In 2012, I received a bachelor scholarship based on academic success to study mathematics in Morocco. During my curriculum there, I discovered for the first time computer programming and felt in love with it. My goal at that time was to become an applied mathematics engineer so that I'll have the opportunity to do mathematics and computer science at the same. In 2018 I achieved the dream and doubly graduated in applied mathematics engineering et master's in computer science, both with honors. During the latter curriculums, I was introduced to machine learning and wanted to learn more. I then did a Ph.D. thesis in computer science and machine learning during which I developed new clustering algorithms.

Overall, I've always been exited and interested in solving problems and i do think that mathematics and computer science are great tools to help us understand and solve complex problems which can lead to having great impacts on our society and facilitate our daily living.
