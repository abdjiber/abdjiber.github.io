About
------
Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I'm Abdoul, a postdoctoral researcher at Simon Fraser University in Canada, and I'm 28 years old and, a French and Nigerien national. I have a Ph.D., a Master's in Computer Science, a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics, and an Engineer's degree in Applied Mathematic. My professional expertise has mostly been creating innovative Machine Learning models and utilizing cutting-edge methods to glean insights from health data. My current research focuses on identifying changeable factors—such as lifestyle choices—rather than immutable ones—like age or genetics—that might help the older adult population become cognitively healthy. I'm also working on examining data to determine changeable factors that can help for a fast recovery of patients with traumatic brain injury and examining how microbiota and the brain are related. I have had the incredible chance to collaborate with outstanding people from all around the world thanks to the interdisciplinarity of neuroscience and cognitive research.


My Relationship with Mathematics and Computer Science

Since junior high school in Niger, mathematics has been one of the subjects in which I find the passage of time to be particularly slow while answering problems. I was awarded a bachelor's scholarship in 2012 to study mathematics in Morocco based on my academic performance. I first learned about computer programming there throughout my coursework and immediately fell in love with it. At the time, I wanted to work as an applied mathematics engineer so I could combine my interests in math and computer technology. In 2018, I realized a lifelong goal and earned honors degrees in both computer science and applied mathematical engineering. I learned about machine learning during the latter curricula and was interested in learning more. Later on, I worked on a computer science and machine learning Ph.D. thesis where I created novel clustering techniques.

Overall, I've always been enthusiastic and interested in finding solutions to problems, and I do believe that mathematics and computer science are excellent tools for assisting us in comprehending and resolving complex issues that have the potential to greatly impact our society and improve our daily lives.
