About 
------
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics](https://med.stanford.edu/bioethics.html), where I study AI's ethical, legal, and social implications. My research focuses on three key areas:

- **AI Bias and Fairness**: My work in AI bias and fairness lies from a technical and practical perspective. From a technical perspective, I develop new bias and fairness metrics, as well as fairness-aware AI models. This work [includes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01711) novel individual fairness and an extended fairness-aware Logistic Regression model. Practically, I am working on stakeholder engagement in bias mitigation efforts, specifically on how stakeholders can help AI developers identify non-apparent subpopulations at risk of AI harm. This work is motivated by the fact that most group fairness interventions rely on apparent subpopulations, such as demographics, assuming that vulnerable populations are known, which is not always the case.

- **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**: In this work, in collaboration with Dr. Mildred Cho and Dr. Nicole Martinez-Martin, we engage AI practitioners to understand how they conceptualize and formalize diversity, equity, and inclusion in the collection of datasets, AI development, and deployment. The project aims to develop guidance to support the creation of fair datasets for healthcare AI.

- **Ethical Implications of Healthcare AI Tools**: I am working with Dr. Michelle Mello and Dr. Danton Char at the [HEAL-AI Lab](https://impact.stanford.edu/healthcare-ai) to assess the ethical considerations surrounding healthcare AI tools considered for deployment at Stanford Healthcare. We engage various stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, AI developers, and providers, in our assessment to hear their concerns about the AI tools.


Before joining Stanford, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in AI and cognitive aging at Simon Fraser University. I applied AI to determine the association between lifestyle activities and cognitive health, aiming to personalize interventions that mitigate cognitive decline in older adults. I also undertook a short postdoctoral fellowship at Clermont Auvergne University, where I contributed to the development of an innovative, explainable algorithm and a concept drift detection method for stream data.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, an MSc in Computer Science, an MEng in Applied Mathematics from Clermont Auvergne University, and a BSc in Applied Mathematics from Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University. My academic journey has been recognized with several prestigious grants, awards, and distinctions, including the Mitacs Accelerate Postdoctoral Fellowship Grant and recognition as one of the top-performing Nigerien students in France in 2019.

I am excited about developing technologies that benefit everyone and contributing to socio-technical projects to achieve this endeavor.

Projects
-------
- [LLM Water Tracker](https://github.com/abdjiber/llm-water-tracker): I attended a seminar at Stanford on responsible AI during which a panelist made a call on the awareness of LLMs environmental impact, notably, the cost of inference on water usage. I spent a weekend developing **LLM Water Tracker**, a Google Chrome Extension that tracks LLM inference water usage equivalence across web LLM platforms including chatgpt.com, gemini.google.com, and claude.ai. This tool aims to help people make environmentally conscious LLM use. 
ZarmaTrad: My mother tongue is Zarma, a dialect spoken in Niger and Mali. It is an oral-only language and is under-resourced. On the Internet, we could find only dictionaries from almost twenty years ago in English, French, and Zarma. Our goal is to develop an AI machine translation model for this language.
