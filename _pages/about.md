About
------
Since my junior high school in Niger, mathematics has always fascinated me. It was at this time the only domain for which I couldn't see the time passing when solving problems. I left Niger to Morroco in 2012 to study mathematics for three years. I discovered computer science programming during this curriculum and wanted to pursue my studies in both mathematics and computer science in France. Three years after, I doubly graduated in applied mathematics engineering et master's in computer science. During the latter curriculum, I discovered machine learning and wanted to learn more about the domain. I then did a Ph.D. thesis in computer science and machine learning. Today, I'm applying my knowledge and experience as a machine learning scientist engineer (R&D).

An ideal work environment for me would be an environment where there are continuous learning opportunities, an environment where quantitative methods such as mathematics and computer science can be used to tackle complex problems, and finally an environment where people with different backgrounds put their efforts to improve existing products or come up with innovative ones.

Background and History
------
From Niger to Morocco to France, the major of my curriculum was in mathematics.
It all started in 2009 in Zinder in Niger when I was admitted to the national entrance exam of the high school of Excellence of Niamey (capital of Niger). The school selects the best students around the country. During my curriculum there, I started falling in love with mathematics. After three years of hard work, I had my baccalaureate (with honors, grade 15.5 / 20) in mathematics and had a three years cooperation scholarship between governments of Niger and Morocco to study mathematics in the latter country at the [Faculty of Sciences and Technologies](https://fst-usmba.ac.ma/). Still in love (much more ...) with mathematics, after my licentiate degree in 2015, I was admitted by portfolio in mathematics and modeling engineering at the [Polytechnic engineering school](http://polytech.univ-bpclermont.fr/-Genie-mathematique-et-modelisation-110-.html) (Grande école) in France. In parallel to the last year of my engineering degree, I did a double curriculum in Master of Science in Computer Science at [ISIMA](https://www.isima.fr/) (Grande école). In 2018, I then doubly graduated in Engineering and Master of Science with honors (grades respectively 15.5 / 20 and 14 / 20). After a research internship at the computer science laboratory [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/), I had a three years funded Ph.D. thesis in computer science and machine learning. I graduated in September 2021, and join Prevision.io as a machine learning scientist.
