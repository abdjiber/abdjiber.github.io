About 
------
Dr Abdoul Jalil Djiberou Mahamadou is a postdoctoral scholar in AI ethics at the [Stanford Centre for Biomedical Ethics](https://med.stanford.edu/bioethics.html). He is part of the inaugural cohort of the Stanford-GSK.ai fellowship on AI's ethical, legal, and social implications in healthcare. He's passionate about developing technologies that benefit everyone, specifically, socio-technical, context and culturally sensitive AI risk evaluation frameworks. At Stanford, his research focuses on algorithmic bias and fairness, stakeholder engagement in [AI risk assessment](https://impact.stanford.edu/healthcare-ai) at Stanford Health Care, and global health.  Before joining Stanford, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship in AI and cognitive aging at Simon Fraser University, where he studied the association between lifestyle activities and cognitive health. He also undertook a short postdoctoral fellowship at Clermont Auvergne University, where he contributed to the development of an explainable algorithm for anomaly and concept drift detection in stream data. Dr Djiberou hold a PhD in Computer Science, an MSc in Computer Science, an MEng in Applied Mathematics from Clermont Auvergne University, and a BSc in Applied Mathematics from Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University. His academic journey has been recognised with several prestigious fellowships, awards, and distinctions, including the Mitacs Accelerate Postdoctoral Fellowship and recognition as one of the top-performing Nigerien students in France in 2019.

Personal Projects
-------
- [LLM Water Tracker](https://github.com/abdjiber/llm-water-tracker): I attended a seminar at Stanford on responsible AI during which a panellist made a call on the awareness of LLMs' environmental impact, notably, the cost of inference on water usage. I spent a weekend developing **LLM Water Tracker**, a Google Chrome Extension that tracks LLM inference water usage equivalence across web LLM platforms, including chatgpt.com, gemini.google.com, and claude.ai. This tool aims to help people make environmentally conscious LLM use. 
- **ZarmaTrad**: My mother tongue is Zarma, a dialect spoken in Niger and Mali. It is an oral-only language and is under-resourced. On the Internet, we could find only dictionaries from almost twenty years ago in English, French, and Zarma. Our goal is to develop an AI machine translation model for this language.
