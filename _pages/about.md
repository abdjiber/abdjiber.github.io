About
------
Hello! Thank you for visiting my webpage. My name is Abdoul and I am currently a Stanford and GSK.ai fellow in AI and Biomedical Ethics. I'm a former fellow in AI and Cognitive Neuroscience at Simon Fraser University in Canada. I hold a Ph.D. and an MSc in Computer Science, an Engineer's degree (MEng) in Applied Mathematics; and a BSc in Applied Mathematics respectively from Université Clermont Auvergne in France and Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah in Morocco. I specialize in creating innovative Machine Learning models and utilizing advanced methods to extract insights from health data. My primary areas of expertise are in machine learning algorithm development, uncertainty modeling, explainable AI, and time series/data stream analysis.

My Relationship with Mathematics and Computer Science
------
Ever since I was in junior high school in Niger, I have always had a passion for mathematics and found the subject particularly engaging. This passion led to me being awarded a bachelor's scholarship in 2012 to study mathematics in Morocco, based on my strong academic performance. It was during my coursework in Morocco that I discovered my interest in computer programming and became captivated by its potential. My goal was to become an applied mathematics engineer, where I could blend my interests in mathematics and computer technology. In 2018, I was able to achieve this goal, by earning honors degrees in both computer science and applied mathematical engineering. Through this education, I became interested in machine learning and sought to learn more about it. Eventually, I pursued a Ph.D. in computer science and machine learning, where I created new clustering techniques.
