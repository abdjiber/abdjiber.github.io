About
------
Hi! I am DJIBEROU MAHAMADOU Abdoul Jalil, I am a Ph.D student (last year) in Computer Science and Machine Learning.
I love coding, using Machine Learning to tackle real-world challenges and learning new skills. In 2018 I doubly graduated in mathematics and modeling engineering and master of science in computer science. I was awarded in 2019 the Excellence Prize by the Réseau des Etudiants Nigériens en France.

<!--After my Ph.D I would like to work as a Machine Learning [Research] Engineer to solve real world problems.

An ideal position for me will be where:

   - I can develop or improve products particularly AI’s one
   - I can do mathematics, statistics and computer science
   - I can continuously learn and share my knowledge
   - I can optionally do research
-->

Background and History
------
From Niger to Morocco to France, the major of my curriculum has been in mathematics.
All started in 2009 in Zinder in Niger when I admitted to the national entrance exam of the high school of Excellence of Niamey (capital of Niger). The school selects the best students around the country. During my curriculum there, I started falling in love with mathematics. After three years of hard work, I had my baccalaureate (with honors, grade 15.5 / 20) in mathematics and had a three years cooperation scholarship between the government of Niger and Morocco for my bachelor. I did the later in Fez in applied mathematics at the [Faculty of Sciences and Technologies](https://fst-usmba.ac.ma/). Still in love (much more ...) with mathematics, after my bachelor in 2015 I admitted by portfolio in mathematics and modeling engineering at the [Polytechnic engineering school](http://polytech.univ-bpclermont.fr/-Genie-mathematique-et-modelisation-110-.html) (Grande école) in France. In parallel of the last year of my engineering degree I did a double curriculum in Master of Science in Computer Science at [ISIMA](https://www.isima.fr/) (Grande école). In 2018 I then doubly graduated in Engineering and Master of Science with honors (grades respectively 15.44 / 20 and 14 / 20). After a research internship at the computer science laboratory [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/), I had a three years funded Ph.D and now doing amazing research both in mathematics and Computer Science.
