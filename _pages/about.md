About
------
Hi! I am a Ph.D student (last year) in Computer Science and Machine Learning with a strong background in mathematics and computer science. My research holds on the development of new clustering methods for mixed data (numeric and qualitative) and applications of these methods in health data analysis.

I am passionate about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and have been doing online training and participating in data science competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/) and [Data Science Olympics](https://www.datascience-olympics.com/) on my free time to learn and acquire new skills.

After my Ph.D I'd like to work as a Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Artificial Intelligence Research Engineer to tackle real-world challenges.

Research
------
Real-world data usually contain mixed data types as numerical, categorical, sequence, etc... To extract valuable information from these data one can use for instance machine learning methods. However, in the litterature there exists mostly methods for handling one data type. Therefore one should convert the other data types to match the one of the method. For instance converting all non-numeric data to numeric. This convertion leads most of the time to loss of information.

In my thesis we are interested in developing unsupervised machine learning methods that can efficiently handle numerical and qualitative data. In particular, we are interested in developing these methods in the fuzzy framework that can express the incertitude of assigning objects to the classes.

Background and History
------
My background is in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**. From Niger to Morocco to France, the major of my curriculum has been in mathematics.
All started in 2009 in Zinder in Niger when I successfully passed the national entrance exam of the high school of Excellence of Niamey (capital of Niger) which selects the best students around the country. During my curriculum in this school, I started falling in love with mathematics. After three years of high school, I had my baccalaureate (with honors, grade 15.5 / 20) in mathematics and had a three years cooperation scholarship between the government of Niger and Morocco for my bachelor which I did in Fez in Applied mathematics at the Faculty of Sciences and Technologies. Still in love with mathematics, after my bachelor in 2015 I admitted by portfolio in mathematics and modeling at the [Polytechnic engineering school](http://polytech.univ-bpclermont.fr/-Genie-mathematique-et-modelisation-110-.html) of the Universit√© Clermont Auvergne in France. In parallel of the last year of my engineering degree I did a double curriculum in Master of Science in Computer Science at [ISIMA](https://www.isima.fr/). In 2018 I then doubly graduated in Engineering and Master of Science with honors (respectively 15.44 / 20 and 14 / 20). After a research internship at the Computer science laboratory [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/) I had a three years Ph.D scholarship and now doing amazing research both in mathematics and Computer Science.
