About
------
Hello! Thank you for visiting my webpage. My name is Abdoul and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Digital Health Research Laboratory at Simon Fraser University in Canada. I am 28 years old and hold dual French and Nigerien (Niger not Nigeria :)) nationality. I have a Ph.D., an MSc in Computer Science, a BSc in Applied Mathematics, and an Engineer's degree in Applied Mathematics. I specialize in creating innovative Machine Learning models and utilizing advanced methods to extract insights from health data. My current research projects focus on identifying modifiable factors such as lifestyle choices that may promote cognitive health in older adults, and on the examination of data to identify factors that can aid in the recovery of patients with traumatic brain injury, as well as understanding the relationship between microbiota and the brain. I have had the opportunity to collaborate with outstanding individuals from around the world, thanks to the interdisciplinary nature of neuroscience and cognitive research.

My Relationship with Mathematics and Computer Science
------
Ever since I was in junior high school in Niger, I have always had a passion for mathematics and found the subject particularly engaging. This passion led to me being awarded a bachelor's scholarship in 2012 to study mathematics in Morocco, based on my strong academic performance. It was during my coursework in Morocco that I discovered my interest in computer programming and became captivated by its potential. My goal was to become an applied mathematics engineer, where I could blend my interests in both mathematics and computer technology. In 2018, I was able to achieve this goal, by earning honors degrees in both computer science and applied mathematical engineering. Through this education, I developed an interest in machine learning and sought to learn more about it. Eventually, I pursued a Ph.D. in computer science and machine learning, where I created new clustering techniques.
