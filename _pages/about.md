About 
------
I'm Abdoul Jalil Djiberou Mahamadou! I'm a Stanford and GSK.ai postdoctoral fellow in AI and Biomedical Ethics. I'm investigating the ethical, legal, and social implications of healthcare AI to recommend policies for the responsible development and use of AI. My research focuses on developing culturally sensitive ethical AI frameworks that align with community values, norms, and beliefs with a case study in Africa. On the technical lens, my work explores the co-design between AI experts and marginalized communities of technical bias and fairness solutions. My work also explores the potential of AI for health equity and global health. Prior to Stanford, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in AI and cognitive aging at Simon Fraser University in Canada. During this fellowship, I used explainable AI to determine the association between lifestyle activities and the cognitive health of older adults to mitigate cognitive decline. Before Canada, I completed a short postdoctoral fellowship in France where I contributed to developing a new explainable and concept drift detection algorithm for stream data.  

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, an MSc in Computer Science (joint degree), an MEng in Applied Mathematics from Clermont Auvergne University in France, and a BSc in Applied Mathematics from the University of Fez in Morocco. I received prestigious grants, awards, and distinctions including the Mitacs Accelerate Postdoctoral Fellowship Grant and the top-performing Nigerien students in France.
