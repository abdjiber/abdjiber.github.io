About 
------
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics](https://med.stanford.edu/bioethics.html), where I study AI's ethical, legal, and social implications. My research focuses on three key areas:

- **AI Bias and Fairness**: My work in AI bias and fairness lies from a technical and practical perspective. From a technical lens, I develop new bias and fairness metrics and fairness-aware AI models. This work [includes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01711) novel individual fairness and an extended fairness-aware Logistic Regression model. Practically, I am working on stakeholder engagement in bias mitigation efforts, specifically, how stakeholders can help AI developers identify non-apparent sub-populations at risk of AI harm. This work is motivated by the fact that most group fairness interventions rely on apparent subpopulations such as demographics assuming that the vulnerable populations are known which is not always true in practice.

- **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**: In this work, in collaboration with Dr. Mildred Cho and Dr. Nicole Martinez-Martin we engage AI practitioners to understand how they conceptualize and formalize diversity, equity, and inclusion in the collection of datasets, AI development, and deployment. The project aims to develop guidance to support the creation of fair datasets for healthcare AI.

- **Ethical Implications of Healthcare AI Tools**: I am working with Dr. Michelle Mello and Dr. Danton Char at the [HEAL-AI Lab](https://impact.stanford.edu/healthcare-ai) to assess the ethical considerations surrounding healthcare AI tools considered for deployment Stanford Healthcare. We engage various stakeholders including patients, clinicians, AI developers, and providers in our assessment to hear their concerns about the AI tools.


Before joining Stanford, I completed a postdoctoral AI and cognitive aging fellowship at Simon Fraser University. I applied AI to determine the association between lifestyle activities and cognitive health for personalized interventions to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults. I also undertook a short postdoctoral fellowship at Clermont Auvergne University, contributing to developing an innovative explainable algorithm and a concept drift detection method for stream data.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, an MSc in Computer Science, an MEng in Applied Mathematics from Clermont Auvergne University, and a BSc in Applied Mathematics from Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University. My academic journey has been recognized with several prestigious grants, awards, and distinctions, including the Mitacs Accelerate Postdoctoral Fellowship Grant and recognition as one of the top-performing Nigerien students in France in 2019.

I am excited about developing technologies that benefit everyone and contributing to socio-technical projects to achieve this endeavor.
