**[PhiField](https://abdouljalilm.wixsite.com/phifield)** provides farmers with a set of easy-to-use connected solutions.

Thanks to artificial intelligence, local weather data and those of the soil make it possible to track the needs of plants and to irrigate at the right time and for the right time. Our expertise also allows data to support the farmer in his decision making every day from sowing to harvest.

We are a team of three people with complementary skills: a Ph.D in Computer Science and Machine Learning, an electrical engineer and a business analyst, working to develop the solution Phifield that will enable farmers to better manage its resources by optimizing its profitability, its use of water and its intervention time.
